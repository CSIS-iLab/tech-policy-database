This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject’s acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes.

Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.</p>"

Depending on the specific cultural, social or political context, it might include <strong>data related to an individual’s personal health or sexual preferences, religious beliefs, or racial or ethnic origins</strong>.</p><p>In certain circumstances, this data might be considered entitled to special protection because its improper handling or disclosure would intrude deeply upon the personal dignity and honor of the individual concerned and could trigger unlawful or arbitrary discrimination against the individual or result in risk of serious harm to the individual.</p><p>The nature of the sensitivity may vary from situation to situation. In certain settings and cultures, for example, it is entirely predictable that disclosure of certain types of personal data might result in harm to personal reputation, discrimination with respect to employment or freedom of movement, political persecution, or even physical violence, while by distinction disclosure of the same data in other circumstances would pose no difficulties at all.</p><p>Within the Member States of the OAS, a wide variety of cultural and legal settings exists, making it difficult to say, as a general matter, which specific types of data are categorically more likely to lead to especially serious encroachments on individual rights and interests.</p><p>Accordingly, appropriate guarantees should be established within the context of national law and rules, reflecting the circumstances within the relevant jurisdiction, to ensure that the privacy interests of individuals are sufficiently protected. <strong>Member States should identify clearly the categories of personal data which are considered especially “sensitive” and therefore require enhanced protection. Explicit consent of the individual concerned should be the governing rule for the collection, disclosure and use of sensitive personal data</strong>. The context in which a person provides such data should be taken into account when determining any applicable regulatory obligations.</p><p>The burden must be placed on data controllers to assess the material risks to data subjects as part of the overall process of risk management and privacy impact assessment. Holding data controllers accountable will result in more meaningful protection of data subjects from material harm across a wide range of cultural contexts.</p><p>(Second Principle - Commentary) </p><p><strong>Sensitive personal data may only be processed without the individual’s explicit consent</strong> where it is clearly in the substantial <strong>public interest </strong>(as authorized by law) or in the <strong>vital interests of the data subject</strong> (for instance, in a life-threatening emergency).</p>"
