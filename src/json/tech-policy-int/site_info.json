  "intro_paragraph": "This table provides a resource for researchers and policymakers involved in the creation of data governance frameworks at the national and international level. We have selected ten of the most influential data governance frameworks proposed internationally, and have mapped each one to their positions across thirty different definitions and principles.",
  "methodology": "We identified ten international data governance frameworks that are shaping the global data governance debate and broke them down based on how they define and address key data governance principles. We attempted to include a range of agreements representative of multiple regions as well as multiple philosophical approaches to the issues involved. The table breaks out key principles driving current policy conversations, and which highlight importance differences in approach between the various frameworks.",
