  "intro_paragraph": "This table provides a resource for researchers and policymakers involved in the creation of data governance frameworks at the national and international level. We have selected ten of the most influential data governance frameworks proposed internationally, and have mapped each one to their positions across thirty different definitions and principles.",
  "methodology": "We selected ten international data governance frameworks for analysis based on an evaluation of their current impact on policy discussions. We attempted to include a range of agreements representative of multiple regions as well as multiple philosophical approaches to the issues involved. Our selection of principles to catalog was based off an assessment of which issues were driving current policy conversations, as well as which issues offered an opportunity to highlight the differences in approach between frameworks.",
