In certain settings and cultures, for example, it is entirely predictable that disclosure of certain types of personal data might result in harm to personal reputation, discrimination with respect to employment or freedom of movement, political persecution, or even physical violence, while by distinction disclosure of the same data in other circumstances would pose no difficulties at all.</p><p>Within the Member States of the OAS, a wide variety of cultural and legal settings exists, making it difficult to say, as a general matter, which specific types of data are categorically more likely to lead to especially serious encroachments on individual rights and interests.</p><p>Accordingly, appropriate guarantees should be established within the context of national law and rules, reflecting the circumstances within the relevant jurisdiction, to ensure that the privacy interests of individuals are sufficiently protected. Member States should identify clearly the categories of personal data which are considered especially “sensitive” and therefore require enhanced protection.

An individual is not considered “identifiable” if his or her identification would require unreasonable time, effort or resources. Such is the case, for example, when identifying a data subject would require excessively complex, long and costly operations. The issue of what constitutes “unreasonable time, efforts or resources” should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For example, consideration could be given to the purpose of the processing and taking into account objective criteria such as the cost, the benefits of such an identification, the type of controller, the technology used, etc. Furthermore, technological and other developments may change what constitutes “unreasonable time, effort or other resources”.</p><p>The notion of “identifiable” refers not only to the individual’s civil or legal identity as such, but also to what may allow to “individualise” or single out (and thus allow to treat differently) one person from others. This “individualisation” could be done, for instance, by referring to him or her specifically, or to a device or a combination of devices (computer, mobile phone, camera, gaming devices, etc.) on the basis of an identification number, a pseudonym, biometric or genetic data, location data, an IP address, or other identifier. The use of a pseudonym or of any digital identifier/digital identity does not lead to anonymisation of the data as the data subject can still be identifiable or individualised. Pseudonymous data is thus to be considered as personal data and is covered by the provisions of the Convention. The quality of the pseudonymisation techniques applied should be duly taken into account when assessing the appropriateness of safeguards implemented to mitigate the risks to data subjects.</p><p>Data is to be considered as anonymous only as long as it is impossible to re-identify the data subject or if such re-identification would require unreasonable time, effort or resources, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. Data that appears to be anonymous because it is not accompanied by any obvious identifying element may, nevertheless in particular cases (not requiring unreasonable time, effort or resources), permit the identification of an individual. This is the case, for example, where it is possible for the controller or any person to identify the individual through the combination of different types of data, such as physical, physiological, genetic, economic, or social data (combination of data on the age, sex, occupation, geolocation, family status, etc.). Where this is the case, the data may not be considered anonymous and is covered by the provisions of the Convention.</p>"

This can for instance be the case where there is a potential risk of discrimination or injury to an individual’s dignity or physical integrity, where the data subject’s most intimate sphere, such as his or her sex life or sexual orientation, is being affected, or where processing of data could affect the presumption of innocence.</p><p>...</p><p>Specific types of data processing may entail a particular risk for data subjects independently of the context of the processing. This is, for instance, the case with the processing of genetic data, which can be left by individuals and can reveal information on the health or filiation of the person, as well as of third parties. Genetic data are all data relating to the genetic characteristics of an individual which have been either inherited or acquired during early prenatal development, as they result from an analysis of a biological sample from the individual concerned: chromosomal, DNA or RNA analysis or analysis of any other element enabling equivalent information to be obtained. Similar risks occur with the processing of data related to criminal offences (which includes suspected offences), criminal convictions (based on criminal law and in the framework of criminal proceedings) and related security measures (involving deprivation of liberty for instance) which require the provision of appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.</p><p>Processing of biometric data, that is data resulting from a specific technical processing of data concerning the physical, biological or physiological characteristics of an individual which allows the unique identification or authentication of the individual, is also considered sensitive when it is precisely used to uniquely identify the data subject.</p><p>The context of the processing of images is relevant to the determination of the sensitive nature of the data. The processing of images will not generally involve processing of sensitive data as the images will only be covered by the definition of biometric data when being processed through a specific technical mean which permits the unique identification or authentication of an individual. Furthermore, where processing of images is intended to reveal racial, ethnic or health information (see the following point), such processing will be considered as processing of sensitive data. On the contrary, images processed by a video surveillance system solely for security reasons in a shopping area will not generally be considered as processing of sensitive data.</p>"

It will also have to consider respect for the proportionality principle on the basis of a comprehensive overview of the intended processing. In some circumstances, where a processor is involved in addition to the controller, the processor will also have to examine the risks. IT systems developers, including security professionals, or designers, together with users and legal experts could assist in examining the risks.\n\nParagraph 3 specifies that in order to better guarantee an effective level of protection, controllers, and, where applicable, processors, should ensure that data protection requirements are integrated as early as possible, that is, ideally at the stage of architecture and system design, in data processing operations through technical and organisational measures (data protection by design). This implementation of data protection requirements should be achieved not only as regards the technology used for processing the data, but also the related work and management processes. Easy-to-use functionalities that facilitate compliance with applicable law should be put in place. For example, secure online access to one’s own data should be offered to data subjects where possible and relevant. There should also be easy-to-use tools to enable data subjects to take their data to another provider of their choice or keep the data themselves (data portability tools). When setting up the technical requirements for default settings, controllers and processors should choose privacy-friendly standard configurations so that the usage of applications and software does not infringe the rights of the data subjects (data protection by default), notably to avoid processing more data than necessary to achieve the legitimate purpose. For example, social networks should be configured by default so as to share posts or pictures only with restricted and chosen circles and not with the whole internet."
